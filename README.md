## Summary
This program models an online shopping store, where the customer can add and remove items from their cart. The customer can also check the items in their cart, as well as the total cost of their cart. The customer can also choose to check the product information of a desired product, where information regarding that product will be outputted to the screen. Once the customer is finished shopping, the customer can then check out, where a final total will be calculated alongside an estimated delivery date. In addition,the shipping destination will be outputted to the user using the information they input into the online store at the beginning of the program. To store the products in the store, different product classes such as Mouse, Laptop, and Keyboard are used to store related information about each individual product.There are subclasses to store items that are extensions of a more general parent class.
